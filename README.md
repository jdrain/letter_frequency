# letter_frequency
This repository holds files for a counter that will record character frequency in large text files, and use that data to encode it with Huffman Coding.
Hopefully it will be of some use in coming up with an encoding scheme for specialized data.

Issues:
  + Now we need to add functionality that actually encodes and decodes files
